# major difference is list start with [] and tuple with ()
# Creating a tuple using ()
t = (1, 2, 4 ,5)
# t1 =()  # Empty tuple
t1 = (5,) # wrong way is  t1 = (5)  Use comma in tuple
print(t1)
# Printing the elements of a tuple
# print(t[0])
 
 # Cannot be updated the values of tuple
# t[0]=34 It throws an error
